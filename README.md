<p align="center"><em>Where a struggle between humanity and its creations quietly persists, can you possess free will, or are you part of a greater design?</em></p>

**Blade of Valor** is a 2D game that combines the power of Phaser 3, Next.js, and a FastAPI backend to deliver a unique gameplay experience. The game explores themes of free will and the consequences of actions through a storyline inspired by Grimes' 'Player of Games' and aspects of Legend(1985). The protagonist, Elara, navigates a world filled with ghouls, using her skills in sword combat.

## Introduction
